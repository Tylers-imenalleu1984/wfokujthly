Bro, just watched The Accountant 2 and man, what a RIDE! I mean, I went in expecting some action, but wow, that was like a mad rollercoaster with numbers and bullets flying everywhere. 😂 Seriously, you gotta see it to believe it. Ben Affleck, man, the dude’s still got it. His character, still there, just more intense and calculated. And I can't get over how they manage to make balancing a ledger look as intense as defusing a bomb, you know what I mean?

Anyway, I'm kinda tired now but like amped at the same time? Makes no sense, but whatever. There's so much going on, I almost feel it needs a whole Excel sheet just to keep track of the plot. 🤣 And those action scenes! I won't spoil it, but there was this one moment where I almost spilled my drink, it was that wild. Like, how do they even come up with this stuff?

> Oh, totally random, but I mentioned to someone the other day, like, why don't we just download the movie and have a chill night in? But nope, they wanted to go all old-school big screen. Honestly, not the worst idea, though. Had the surround sound and everything, so with all the gunshots and smashing glass, it felt like a live concert for my anxiety. 😂

What even was that subplot with the sister? It felt like they stitched two different films together just for the heck of it! And that hacker dude, hands down my favorite character. Some parts of the film were a little eh, seen it before, but it'll def keep you engaged.

Anyway, I think the real takeaway here is that somehow they made algebra feel dangerous. 🤣 Like, props to them, but also, why? Why am I rooting for a dude who probably does math in his sleep? And why am I laughing every time something explodes? Wild mix.

Alright, I’m off to hit the sack. My brain’s fried, but in a good way. Catch this one whenever you can. Seriously, it’ll surprise you. Peace out for now! ✌️
